Hello! I’m a passionate software engineer with a academic foundation in computational mathematics and a deep interest in cutting-edge technology. I hold a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics, where I focused on numerical method of partial differential equations (PDEs) and the inverse problems about geophysics. 

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at a Chinese IC company, where I specialize in kernel development and optimization for GPGPU platforms. My primary focus is on accelerating deep learning models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to harness the full potential of our custom chips. I thrive on solving complex problems at the intersection of hardware and software, ensuring that our solutions are both efficient and scalable.

In my role, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to design and implement optimized kernels that push the boundaries of performance for AI workloads. Whether it’s improving inference speeds, reducing memory footprint, or enhancing parallelism, I’m dedicated to delivering solutions that empower the next generation of AI applications.

When I’m not immersed in code, I enjoy reading books about chinese ancient history. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge, and I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about technology and innovation.
